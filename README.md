### Oh hello, Mr. Black here. Aside from my many cinematic successes such as Kung Fu Panda 2 and Jumanji: The Next Level, I am avid gambler. So much so that they named my game of choice after me. It used to be called "21 or bust", but has since been renamed **BlackJack**, an honor I will forever cherish. 

### Anywho, with my hectic schedule, I seldom have time to play in person. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make me the greatest digital game of blackjack anyone has ever experienced. I specifically want it to be built with Javascript, and I only want it to be excecuted via the command line or alert boxes in the browser. It's almost impossible you don't know what blackjack is, or the rules, but if somehow you don't know, here is a [link](https://www.888casino.com/blog/blackjack-strategy-guide/how-to-play-blackjack) to rules and everything else you need to knoww.

### If that was too long and you refused to read, here are my requirements, in game order. Feel free to use this list to keep track of what you have done:

- [ ] We need to have a deck, which contains 52 cards
- [ ] The deck needs to be shuffled 
- [ ] Cards need to be dealt from the deck
- [ ] The players need to be able to have a hand of dealt cards
- [ ] The players need to have some moola, cash, DINERO
- [ ] The player needs to be able to bet moola 
- [ ] When the player wins, moola needs to be added to their bankroll
- [ ] When the player loses, moola needs to be removed from theit bankrol
- [ ] We need to implement all of the logic of "21 or Bust" aka blackjack

# Homework 1
// Make a deck

// Make a player

// Have the player draw 2 cards

// Have the player make a wager

// Print out players hand

// Print out wager amount



# Outstanding Issues

- Running out of cards
  - Return all cards to the deck after each hand
  - When deck gets down to certain number of cards, restart/reshuffle deck
  - Use more than one

- We are currently keeping all cards between hands
- Loops not breaking when they are supposed(When blackjack is recieved, game still continues)
